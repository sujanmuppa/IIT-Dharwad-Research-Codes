## Tasks 

1. Figure out all stakable graphs upto 10 vertices
2. if a graph is aldredy stakable adding one more edge cant make it non-stakable

3. Let G be a diameter 2 graph. Let v be a vertex in G such that the no. of neighbors of v is less than the no. of vertices at a distence of 2 from v. Then v is not stackable.

4. Write down the proof of the following statement: 
    A graph having a hamiltonian path is stackable.

5. Cartesian product 

6. Complete binary tree

7. Charecterisation of eccentricity 3 vertices

8. Split graph : complete split graph
